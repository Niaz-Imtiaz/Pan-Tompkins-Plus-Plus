# Pan-Tompkins++

This repo contains the code accompanying our paper [Pan-Tompkins++: A Robust Approach to Detect R-peaks in ECG Signals](https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.03171) accepted at [IEEE BIBM 2022 workshop CBPBL 2022](https://ieeebibm.org/BIBM2022/).

We propose an efficient R-peak detection algorithm named Pan-Tompkins++. This is an improved Pan-Tompkins algorithm that effectively reduces the False Positives and False Negatives given by the Pan-Tompkins algorithm.
